Birthday went bad!!
I've always stayed at this hotel and I always liked it, but this time things were different
I paid for two nights in a premium room, for 2 adults and 1 child. I ended up taking 1 additional child, the same age, and they charged me 1 extra day for this child without changing the room to better accommodate us... the premium room is terrible, with no sockets around the bed, without a chair on the balcony, away from everything.
I ordered food at the pool restaurant and they simply didn't deliver it to me, the waitress told me that they forgot to place my order!!
It was the worst stay I've ever had at a hotel.
It will definitely be the last. A feather!
I expected more!
